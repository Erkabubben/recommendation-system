<!--
## Description

* In this assignment, you shall implement a recommendation system for the movie's data set.
* You can use any programming language you like.
* You shall present your application and code at an oral examination.

      <ul>
        <li>Build a recommendation system that can find similar users and find recommendations for a user, using the <em>movies large</em> dataset (see <a href="https://coursepress.lnu.se/courses/web-intelligence/assignments/datasets">Datasets</a> page).</li>
        <li>You can verify that your application works by using the example dataset from the lecture (see <a href="https://coursepress.lnu.se/courses/web-intelligence/assignments/datasets">Datasets</a> page).</li>
        <li>Use Euclidean distance as the similarity measure.</li>
        <li>Implement the system using a REST web service where:
          <ol>
            <li>client sends a request to a server</li>
            <li>the server responds with <em>json</em> data</li>
            <li>the <em>json</em> data is decoded and presented in a client GUI</li>
          </ol>

        <li>Use the pre-generated table to implement a second way of finding recommendations for a user.</li>
        <li>You shall only use Euclidean distance as the similarity measure.</li>
        <li>It shall be possible to select how to find recommendations from the client GUI (Item-Based or User-Based).</li>

## Test cases – small example dataset

Here are some test cases for the small example dataset you can use to verify that your system works correctly.

* Find recommended movies for user **Mike** using **Euclidean distance**:<br />![A1-small-Ex1.png](.readme/A1-small-Ex1.png)
* Find recommended movies for user **Mike** using **Pearson similarity**:<br />![A1-small-Ex2.png](.readme/A1-small-Ex2.png)
* Find recommended movies for user **Mike** using **Item-based filtering**:<br />![A1-small-Ex3.png](.readme/A1-small-Ex3.png)

## Test cases – large dataset

Here are some test cases for the larger dataset you can use to verify that your system works correctly.

* Find recommended movies for user **Angela** using **Euclidean distance**:<br />![A1-Ex1.png](.readme/A1-Ex1.png)
* Find recommended movies for user **Will** using **Pearson similarity**:<br />![A1-Ex2.png](.readme/A1-Ex2.png)
* Find recommended movies for user **Andy** using **Item-based filtering**:<br />![A1-Ex3.png](.readme/A1-Ex3.png)

The Recommendation System is split into two separate web applications - <i>RecommendationSystemAPI</i> and <i>RecommendationSystemWebApplication</i>. The API is an ASP.NET REST API written in C# and is responsible for all the backend logic involved with determining movie recommendations. The RecommendationSystemWebApplication is a simple Express server and client written in JavaScript.
## How to start the web applications
The RecommendationSystemAPI can be used independently, but the RecommendationSystemWebApplication is dependent on the API. In order to use the client, first start the API which will then by default be accessible on http://localhost:28999/Recommendations. Then, start the RecommendationSystemWebApplication, and you should be able to access the client at https://localhost:8080/ in your web browser.
## The console application
A .NET console application is also included, as the Recommendation System logic was originally developed within the console app and then implemented into the API. The console app is essentially the same as the API's RecommendationSystemService class.
